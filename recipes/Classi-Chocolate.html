    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies are the quintessential American comfort dessert, beloved for their perfect balance of textures and flavors. When done right, they embody a delightful contrast: a crispy, golden-brown edge that gives way to a chewy, soft, and slightly gooey center.
