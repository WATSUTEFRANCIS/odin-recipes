    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Classic Spaghetti Carbonara is a quintessential Roman pasta dish renowned for its simple yet incredibly rich and creamy sauce. What sets it apart is the absence of cream; its luxurious texture comes from a clever emulsion of eggs (typically yolks, or a mix of whole eggs and yolks), finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and the rendered fat from cured pork.
