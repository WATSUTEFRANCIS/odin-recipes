    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A vegetable curry is a vibrant, aromatic, and often hearty dish made by simmering a medley of vegetables in a richly spiced sauce. It's a cornerstone of many cuisines, particularly in South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka), Southeast Asia (Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia), and the Caribbean.
